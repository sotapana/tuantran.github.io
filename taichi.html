<h3>Tai Chi</h3>
<strong>Introduction</strong><p>

I decided to create this web page to share my discovery. I have written about the subject of Tai Chi as succinctly as possible. I have also distilled the philosophical and spiritual aspects of the art to its most fundamental concept. Wisdom, I believe, has to be discovered through one's own experience. Therefore, what I have written should only confirm what you have already discovered.<p>

Tai Chi is a beautiful art that is rooted in Eastern philosophy. I hope this web page is helpful to you in your journey into the art of Tai Chi.<p>

<strong> Philosophy of Tai Chi</strong><p>

"The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao."<br>
-Lao Tzu<p>

Tai Chi is a method of physical and spiritual cultivation based on the philosophy of Taoism. The source of Taoism is from the book Tao Te Ching, written around sixth century B.C. by Lao Tzu. The Tao Te Ching is a collection of eighty-one short and profound poems, consisting of only about five thousand words. It is only with personal experience that one can grasp the profound wisdom hidden within these concise poems.<p>

The teaching of Lao Tzu is not much different from the teaching of Siddhartha, for enlightened beings speak the same truth. Let us examine the essence of these two philosophies.<p>

Siddhartha's key insight is that attachment leads to suffering, and there is a way to move beyond suffering. To understand this simple truth, it is helpful to look at a metaphor.<p>

A gardener is planting a rose bush in winter. As spring approaches, a rosebud begins to form. Within the span of several weeks time, the rosebud blooms with radiating beauty and intoxicating fragrance. As fall approaches, the rose begins to wither then dies, as with all things in nature. The gardener knows this truth of nature well, so he is not attached to the rose at any moment in time.<p>

Impermanence is the nature of all things in the universe. Thus, attachment to anything at all means that one is attached to that particular object at that particular moment in time, which means that one is not able to accept change as the inherent nature of all things.<p>

The essence of Lao Tzu's Taoism is in "non-action," which means to accept things as they are without wanting them to be different. To put it in a more cliché form, one is: "to go with the flow." The following poems, from the Tao Te Ching, exemplify this concept.<p>

Eight<p>

The highest good is like water<br>
It gives life to all things<br>
and reaches for the lowest<br>
It flows in places men reject<br>
and so is the Tao<p>

Twenty-two<p>

Yield and overcome<br>
Bend and be straight<br>
Empty and be full<br>
Wear out and be new<br>
Have little and gain<br>
Have much and be lost<p>

Thirty-three<p>

Knowing others is wisdom<br>
But to know oneself is enlightenment<br>
Mastering others requires force<br>
But to master oneself requires courage<p>

Thirty-seven<p>

The Tao abides in non-action<br>
Yet nothing is left undone<br>
For without form<br>
there is no desire<br>
Without desire<br>
there is tranquility<br>
And all things would be at peace<p>

Forty<p>

Returning is the motion of the Tao<br>
Yielding is the way of the Tao<p>

Forty-three<p>

The softest thing in the universe<br>
Overcomes the hardest thing in the universe<br>
For without substance<br>
One can enter where there is no room<br>
Thus, one should know the value of non-action<br>
Teaching without words<br>
and work without doing<br>
are understood by very few<p>

Forty-four<p>

One who is attached to things will suffer much<br>
One who saves will suffer heavy loss<br>
A contented man is never disappointed<p>

Forty-six<p>

There is no greater sin than desire<br>
No greater curse than discontent<br>
No greater misfortune than wanting<p>

Forty-eight<p>

In the pursuit of learning<br>
every day something is acquired<br>
In the pursuit of the Tao<br>
every day something is dropped<br>
Less and less is done<br>
Until non-action is achieved<br>
When nothing is done<br>
Nothing is left undone<br>
The world is ruled by letting things take their course<br>
It cannot be ruled by interfering<p>

Seventy<p>

My words are easy to understand<br>
Yet no one practices them<br>
My words have ancient beginnings<br>
And my actions are disciplined<br>
But few know me<br>
Therefore a sage wears rough clothing<br>
and holds the jewel in his heart<p>

Seventy-six<p>

A man is born gentle and soft<br>
At death, he is hard and stiff<br>
Green plants are tender<br>
At death, they are withered and dry<br>
Therefore the stiff and unbending is the disciple of death<br>
The gentle and yielding is the disciple of life<br>
An army without flexibility never wins a battle<br>
A tree that is unbending is easily broken<br>
The hard and strong will fall<br>
The soft and weak will overcome<p>

Seventy-eight<p>

Nothing is more soft and yielding than water<br>
But for attacking the solid and strong<br>
nothing is better<br>
It has no equal<br>
The weak can overcome the strong<br>
The supple can overcome the stiff<br>
Everyone knows this<br>
But no one puts it into practice<p>

<strong> Principles of Tai Chi</strong><p>

"Yield and overcome."<br>
-Lao Tzu<p>

1. Substantial and Insubstantial: Substantial is yang and insubstantial is yin. In the beginning, it is critical to be aware of the shifting of the weight from one foot to the other. When the weight is on one foot, then that foot is yang and the other foot is yin. This is the foundation of establishing rooting. At a higher level, be aware of the substantial and insubstantial of the hands as well. Thus, when one hand is yang, then the other hand is yin. At the highest level, there is also substantial and insubstantial of the opposite hand and foot. For example, in "brush knee twist step," the forward striking hand is substantial or yang, and the same foot (rear) is therefore yang also.<p>

2. Chi is moved like a curved thread through nine pearls: The body has nine curves (the fist joint, the wrist joint, the elbow joint, the shoulder joint, the spine, the waist, the hips, the knee joint, and the ankle joint). The chi is moved through these nine joints, so that when one part of the body moves, the entire body moves.<p>

3. Relax "Sung": Tai Chi is known as movement meditation. Thus, the mind (awareness) and chi (breath) are united with movement (in the present moment). The movement is effortless because there is no self. One becomes a detached observer. The muscles are relaxed, and the chi is moved through the ligaments. Beginners need to pay particular attention to the shoulders since the muscular tension is most profound at this point. One needs to relax the shoulders, and drop the elbows while practicing the form. Sung is closely related to Peng Ching.<p>

4. Keep Alignment: The body must be upright, keep the neck and the back straight. The tail-boned is tucked in so that the buttocks are not sticking out. The chest is not sticking out, nor the upper back hunched forward.<p>

5. The source of movements is in the waist and spine as in a wheel revolving around an axle: The waist is rotated around the spine like a wheel revolving around an axle. In this case, the axle is perpendicular to the ground. Thus in movement, the waist is moved horizontal to the ground and rotating around the spine.<p>

6. Stay at the same height: Except for movements such as "Single Whip Squatting Down," stay at the same height while doing the form.<p>

7. The step is light like a cat: When one is aware of substantial and insubstantial, the step will be empty and light. In Tai Chi foot-worked, the step forward is first with the heel then the whole foot. In the step backward, the ball of the foot then the whole foot.<p>

8. Peng Ching: It is potential energy. The whole body must have peng ching at all times while doing the form. It has the sensation of fullness or extension through the joints. It is the culmination of correct postures of three parts: arms, legs, and back. The correct posture for the arms is to drop both shoulders and elbows, and the wrists are straighten. The correct posture for the legs is to keep the buttocks tucked in and the knees bent, the step is light with distinction between solidity and emptiness. The correct posture for the back is to keep the back straight, so that the rotation is around the spine, with the receiving points at the two shoulder joints and the two hips joints. Peng ching's eight gates or positions are as follow: Peng, Lu, Chi, An, Tsai, Lieh, Chou, Kao.<p>

9. Fa Jing: "The root is at the feet, 'Jing' is generated from the legs, controlled by the waist, and expressed by the fingers." It is striking energy. This is preceded by collecting energy through the nine joints equally, with the spine as the main point of collecting and striking. The strike is through the hands, one solid and the other empty, and focus on the opponent's center. Collecting energy is like drawing a bow, and striking energy is like releasing an arrow.<p>

10. Spirit, Mind, and Chi: The mind moves the chi, thus there has to be a mind intent before the chi arrives. At the highest level of the spirit, the mind intent and chi arrive at the same time.<p>

<strong> Biography</strong><p>

"If I can stop one heart from breaking,<br>
I shall not live in vain;<br>
If I can ease one life the aching,<br>
Or cool one pain,<br>
Or help one fainting robin<br>
Unto his nest again,<br>
I shall not live in vain"<br>
-Emily Dickinson<p>

I attended high school in Olympia, Washington, undergraduate school in Business Administration at Western Washington University in Bellingham, Washington, and graduate study in Teacher Education at the Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington.<p>

I began Tai Chi training in 1990 with Master Abraham Liu, a student of Cheng Man Ching, in San Diego, and continued my study with Master Liang Shou-yu in Vancouver, British Columbia. While teaching English in Vietnam for the last few years, I studied privately with a Tai Chi Master in Ho Chi Minh City.<p>

I started teaching Tai Chi in 1995. I taught at Bastyr University in Seattle, in addition to other various locations such as: community centers, health clubs, and churches. Although Tai Chi is a martial art, my interest has always been on the health and spiritual aspect of the art.<p>

My advice to current Tai Chi practitioners, as well as people who are interested in learning Tai Chi, is to seek out a Master who is willing to teach you and give you form correction. Otherwise, you will not be able to learn the art properly.<p>
