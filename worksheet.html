<p>A haiku is a Japanese poem that is about nature. This type of poetry is rooted in Zen Buddhism, which tries to capture a state of mind through concise description of nature.</p>
<p>A haiku poem has three lines with a total of seventeen syllables. The first line has five syllables followed by a comma. The second line has seven syllables followed by a comma. The third line has five syllables followed by a period.

<p>O CAPTAIN! MY CAPTAIN!<br />
O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,<br />
The ship has weather’d every rack, the prize we sought is won,<br />
The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,<br />
While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;<br />
But O heart! heart! heart!<br />
O the bleeding drops of red,<br />
Where on the deck my Captain lies,<br />
Fallen cold and dead.</p>
<p>O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;<br />
Rise up — for you the flag is flung — for you the bugle trills,<br />
For you bouquets and ribbon’d wreaths — for you the shores a-crowding,<br />
For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;<br />
Here Captain! dear father!<br />
This arm beneath your head!<br />
It is some dream that on the deck,<br />
You’ve fallen cold and dead.</p>
<p>My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,<br />
My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,<br />
The ship is anchor’d safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,<br />
From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;<br />
Exult O shores, and ring O bells!<br />
But I with mournful tread,<br />
Walk the deck my Captain lies,<br />
Fallen cold and dead.</p>
